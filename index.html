  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a graduate student in computer science, and my biggest dream is to live the life I truly want.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here’s what my ideal life looks like:
    <ul>
      <li>Own a small apartment and have a 9-to-5 job that is enough to support myself.</li>
      <li>In my free time, I want to perform at a bar, travel with my guitar and watercolors, and meet people from different cultures to learn about their customs.</li>
      <li>On weekends, I will volunteer and help others as much as I can.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    To bring together more people who think like me, I am starting an organization called “<strong>Live Life</strong>.”
  </p>
  <p>
    If you also love life and want to help others, I would love for you to join us.
